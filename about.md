I am excited about technologies and especially fascinated by the current advancement in the fields of AI, Robotics and their real life applications like self-driving cars. 

I am interested in application of  machine learning and computer vision in the field of robotics particularly for solving perception problems like RGBD SLAM  and 3D reconstruction.
