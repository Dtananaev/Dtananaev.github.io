I am excited about technologies and especially fascinated by the current advancement in the fields of AI, Robotics and their real life applications like self-driving cars. 

I am interested in applying the machine learning and computer vision techniques in the field of robotics particularly for solving perception problems like RGB D SLAM and 3D reconstruction.
