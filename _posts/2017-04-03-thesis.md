Depth and motion estimation with fully recurrent convolutional networks in Tensorflow.

Development of the residual recurrent convolutional networks for depth prediction and position estimation for monocular camera.
We compare the performance of the 2D and 3D residual convolutional networks with convolutional LSTM that uses tanh or leaky ReLU activations. We show the importance of the  layer normalization for making non-saturating recurrent networks which are able to process  any length of input sequences.
