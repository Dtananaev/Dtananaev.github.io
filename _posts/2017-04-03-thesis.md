Depth and motion estimation with fully recurrent convolutional networks in Tensorflow.

The depth and relative motion of the camera is the crutial information which is necessary for 3D reconstruction of the environment. The goal of the research project is to define the capabilities of the recurrent neural networks to estimate depth and relative transformations between monocular camera poses given RGB video sequence. The described approach has a procpectives to replace traditional methods for 3D reconstruction like structure from motion method and it could be widely used in robotics as Visual SLAM approach.
