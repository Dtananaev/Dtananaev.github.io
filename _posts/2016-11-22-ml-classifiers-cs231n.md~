---

<img src="https://github.com/Dtananaev/ml_classifiers/raw/master/pictures/2layerNN.JPG" class="teaser-img" />
This project contains  c++ implementation of the K Nearest Neighbor, SVM and Softmax loss functions in addition to the simple two-layer Neural Network. They were developed for visualization and understanding while doing CS231n from Stanford University in 2016 for CIFAR-10 dataset. All classifiers include Qt GUI.

This project contains:

1. K Nearest Neighbor classifier
2. Linear SVM classifier
3. Softmax classifier
4. The 2 layer neural network
5. Multiple normalization possibilities (mean subtraction, normalization, standartization)
6. Moving averages at the test time
