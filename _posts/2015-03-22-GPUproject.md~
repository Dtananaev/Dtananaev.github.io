The GPU project contains the implementation of the non-local mean denoising filter in GPU CUDA. In the frame of the project there were developed naive version of the non-local mean filter which uses sliding window approach for filtering and volumetric kd-tree implementation for video sequences.
The source code for the naive version of the filter is available.

**Source:** [Dtananaev/cuda_filters](https://github.com/Dtananaev/cuda_filters)

The source code contains:

1. Naive Non-Local mean filter implementation
2. Color inversion 
3. Median filter for the "salt and pepper" noise
